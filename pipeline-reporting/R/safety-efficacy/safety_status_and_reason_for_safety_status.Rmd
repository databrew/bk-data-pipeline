### PURPOSE:
# This code aims to determine who is out, refusal, in, and eos after safety. This information comes from Safety, Safetynew, and Absence1stattempt. Then for each status (except of in), split each status into the "reason" or the "how" they got to that status.

## Safety Trial Profile  

This is the safety trial profile which breaks down the people visited from beginning to end. It starts at Demography and ends at V4. The aim is to track every person and household and to understand why they are present or not at each stage and to understand where they go. Because safety was collected at a household and individual level, each safety visit will have a household and individual component.

***

### Demography

Demography started by visiting `r num_hhid_v0_total_visited` households (`r num_extid_v0_total_visited` people). However, `r num_v0_removed_hhid` households (`r num_v0_removed_extid` people) were removed at the study's discretion (due to the dropping of clusters). Therefore, the target for V1 is `r num_hhid_v0_clean` households (`r num_extid_v0_clean` people).  

* Household level: `r num_hhid_v0_total_visited` visited households - `r num_v0_removed_hhid` removed households = `r num_hhid_v0_total_visited - num_v0_removed_hhid` target households
* Individual level: `r num_extid_v0_total_visited` visited individuals - `r num_v0_removed_extid` removed individuals = `r num_extid_v0_total_visited - num_v0_removed_extid` target individuals
  
***

### Safety V1

#### Household Level
While the target number of households to visit in Safety V1 was `r num_hhid_v0_clean`, only `r num_hhid_v1_total_visited` households were visited. This means:

* `r num_hhid_v0_clean` target hhs - `r num_hhid_v1_total_visited` visited hhs = `r num_hhid_v0_clean - num_hhid_v1_total_visited` missed hhs

When we dive deeper to confirm that `r num_hhid_v0_clean - num_hhid_v1_total_visited` households were missed, we find that `r num_hhid_v1_not_visited - num_v1_hhid_visited_extid_not` households were indeed not visited in V1.  

> _NOTE: `r num_v1_hhid_visited_extid_not` households were visited but only had Safety New members enrolled. The other members of the household had no data submitted for that visit._

Now that we have determined why the target hh and visited hh numbers differ, we will begin to find the V2 target number. To create the V3 target, we must remove the hh below:

* `r num_hhid_v1_ref_ref` households had all individuals refuse,  
* `r num_hhid_v1_all_migrations` households had all individuals migrate,  
* `r num_hhid_v1_all_death` households had all individuals die, and   
* `r num_hhid_v1_ref_mig_died` households had all individuals refuse, migrate, or die.
* Total of above = `r num_hhid_v1_ref_ref + num_hhid_v1_all_migrations + num_hhid_v1_all_death + num_hhid_v1_ref_mig_died`  

This means that `r num_hhid_v1_ref_ref + num_hhid_v1_all_migrations + num_hhid_v1_all_death + num_hhid_v1_ref_mig_died` households were removed.

The V1 Clean data will then have the following households:

* `r num_hhid_v1_total_visited` visited - `r num_hhid_v1_100_refusal` = `r num_hhid_v1_total_visited - num_hhid_v1_100_refusal` V1 Clean

Finally, to create the V2 target we want to keep all people who we visited that are not a part of the households removed and we need to include the households who were missed in V1:

* `r num_hhid_v1_total_visited` visited + `r num_hhid_v1_not_visited - num_v1_hhid_visited_extid_not` not visited - `r num_hhid_v1_100_refusal` = `r num_hhid_v1_total_visited + (num_hhid_v1_not_visited - num_v1_hhid_visited_extid_not) - num_hhid_v1_100_refusal` V2 target

So now there is a V2 target of `r num_hhid_v2_target_real` households.

#### Individual Level
At the individual level, people who were registered in Demography go through the Safety form or they can be added to a household in Safety V1, V2, or V3 through the Safety New Members Form. For the purposes of this document we will refer to safety new member people as __type new__ and people who joined a household in Demography as type __OG__.   
> _Note: OG is slang for original._

Safety V1 visited people who were also visited in Demography (type OG) but also visits new people (type new). In total `r num_extid_v1_total_visited` people were visited in Safety V1 of which `r num_extid_v1_new_visited` were new and `r num_extid_v1_og_visited` were OG. 

In the target for V1, new people were not accounted for, only the OG people. So when we compare the V1 target and V1 OG visited we find that `r num_extid_v1_not_visited` people were not visited:  

* `r num_extid_v0_clean` (target) - `r num_extid_v1_og_visited` (OG visited) = `r num_extid_v0_clean - num_extid_v1_og_visited` (missed people)
* These individuals are coming from the `r length(unique(v1_not_visited$hhid)) - length(unique(v1_hhid_visited_extid_not$hhid))` missed households + `r length(unique(v1_hhid_visited_extid_not$hhid))` households which had no Safety submissions (just Safety New Members).

Now that we understand why the target is different, let's clean V1 by removing all migrations, deaths, and 100% refusal households. __A 100% refusal rate household is defined as a household that is completely made up of individuals who refused, or a combination of refused and migrated and/or dead__: 

* `r num_extid_v1_mig_hhs_not_100` migrations (which are not a part of 100% refusal households),    
* `r num_extid_v1_died_hhs_not_100` deaths (which are not a part of 100% refusal households), and    
* `r num_extid_v1_100_refusal` people belonging to 100% refusal households.
  + `r num_extid_v1_mig_hhs_100` people migrated, and
  + `r num_v1_ref_removed` people refused.
  + Total: `r num_extid_v1_mig_hhs_100` + `r num_v1_ref_removed` = `r num_extid_v1_mig_hhs_100 + num_v1_ref_removed` people
* Total of: `r num_extid_v1_mig_hhs_not_100` migrations + `r num_extid_v1_died_hhs_not_100` deaths + `r num_extid_v1_100_refusal` 100% refusals = `r num_extid_v1_mig_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v1_died_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v1_100_refusal` people   

Now when we remove migrations, deaths, and people in 100% refusal households, we get a V1 Clean of `r num_extid_v1_clean`.  

* `r num_extid_v1_total_visited` visited - `r num_extid_v1_mig_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v1_died_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v1_100_refusal` removed = `r num_extid_v1_total_visited - (num_extid_v1_mig_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v1_died_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v1_100_refusal)` V1 Clean

Now that the data has been cleaned, we will calculate the V2 Target number by adding the people missed in V1 to the V1 Clean. The V2 Target will reflect the number of people who can be visited in the next visit (out and in people).

* `r num_v1_in_target` in + `r num_v2_target_out` out = `r num_v1_in_target + num_v2_target_out` V2 Target

However, for calculation purposes there will be a V2 Calculated Target which will include all people on the roster (in, out, refusals, and eos people who did not migrate, died or are part of a 100% refusal household):   

* `r num_extid_v2_target_real` V2 Calculated Target

To double check everything that has been done, the V1 visited people's safety statuses are compared to V1 Clean and V2 Target below: 

```{r v1_safety_statuses}
knitr::kable(v1statuses)
```

* OUT: `r num_v1_out` V1 Visited out - `r num_v1_out_died` died - `r num_v1_out_mig` migrated =  `r num_v1_out - num_v1_out_died - num_v1_out_mig` V1 Clean out + `r num_extid_v1_not_visited` missed people = `r num_v2_target_out_start + num_extid_v1_not_visited` OUT (participants who can still enter the study)
* REFUSAL: `r num_v1_refusal` - `r num_v1_ref_removed` people in 100% removal households = `r num_v1_refusal - num_v1_ref_removed` REFUSAL (participants who refused but belong to hh that are still part of the study)

Finally, all people should follow the pathways below:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = knitr::image_uri('../../asset/safety_pathway_screenshot.jpg'), 
               alt = 'logo', 
               style = 'padding:10px; width:550px; height:200px')
```

We can check this in the following table:

```{r v1_safety_pathway}
knitr::kable(v1_status_pathway)
```

### Safety V2

#### Household Level
While the target number of households to visit in Safety V2 was `r num_hhid_v2_target_real`, only `r num_hhid_v2_total_visited` households were visited. This means:

* `r num_hhid_v2_target_real` target hhs - `r num_hhid_v2_total_visited` visited hhs = `r num_hhid_v2_target_real - num_hhid_v2_total_visited` missed 

When we dive deeper to confirm that `r num_hhid_v2_target_real - num_hhid_v2_total_visited` household was missed, we find that `r num_hhid_v2_not_visited - num_v2_hhid_visited_extid_not` household was indeed not visited in V2.  

> _NOTE: `r num_v2_hhid_visited_extid_not` households were visited but only had Safety New members enrolled. The other members of the household had no data submitted for that visit._

Now that we have determined why the target hh and visited hh numbers differ, we will begin to find the V2 target number. To create the V2 target, we must remove the hh below:

* `r num_hhid_v2_ref_ref` households had all individuals refuse,  
* `r num_hhid_v2_all_migrations` households had all individuals migrate,  
* `r num_hhid_v2_all_death` households had all individuals die, and   
* `r num_hhid_v2_ref_mig_died` households had all individuals refuse, migrate, or die.
* Total of above = `r num_hhid_v2_ref_ref + num_hhid_v2_all_migrations + num_hhid_v2_all_death + num_hhid_v2_ref_mig_died`  

This means that `r num_hhid_v2_ref_ref + num_hhid_v2_all_migrations + num_hhid_v2_all_death + num_hhid_v2_ref_mig_died` households were removed.

The V2 Clean data will then have the following households:

* `r num_hhid_v2_total_visited` visited - `r num_hhid_v2_100_refusal` = `r num_hhid_v2_total_visited - num_hhid_v2_100_refusal` V2 Clean

Finally, to create the V3 target we want to keep all people who we visited that are not a part of the households removed and we need to include the households that were missed in V2:

* `r num_hhid_v2_total_visited` visited + `r num_hhid_v2_not_visited - num_v2_hhid_visited_extid_not` not visited - `r num_hhid_v2_100_refusal` = `r num_hhid_v2_total_visited + (num_hhid_v2_not_visited - num_v2_hhid_visited_extid_not) - num_hhid_v2_100_refusal` V3 target

So now there is a V3 target of `r num_hhid_v3_target_real` households.

#### Individual Level

In total `r num_extid_v2_total_visited` people were visited in Safety V2 of which `r num_extid_v2_new_visited` were new and `r num_extid_v2_og_visited` were OG. 

In the target for V2, new people were not accounted for, only the OG people. So when we compare the V2 calculated target and V2 OG visited we find that `r num_extid_v2_not_visited` people were not visited:  

* `r num_extid_v2_target_real` (calculated target) - `r num_extid_v2_og_visited` (OG visited) = `r num_extid_v2_target_real - num_extid_v2_og_visited` (missed people)
* These individuals are coming from the `r length(unique(v2_not_visited$hhid)) - length(unique(v2_hhid_visited_extid_not$hhid))` missed households + `r length(unique(v2_hhid_visited_extid_not$hhid))` households which had no Safety submissions (just Safety New Members).

Now that we understand why the target is different, let's clean V2 by removing all migrations, deaths, and 100% refusal households: 

* `r num_extid_v2_mig_hhs_not_100` migrations (which are not a part of 100% refusal households),    
* `r num_extid_v2_died_hhs_not_100` deaths (which are not a part of 100% refusal households), and    
* `r num_extid_v2_100_refusal` people belonging to 100% refusal households.
  + `r num_extid_v2_mig_hhs_100` people migrated, 
  + `r num_extid_v2_died_hhs_100` person died, and
  + `r num_v2_ref_removed` people refused.
  + Total: `r num_extid_v2_mig_hhs_100` + `r num_extid_v2_died_hhs_100` + `r num_v2_ref_removed` = `r num_extid_v2_mig_hhs_100 + num_v2_ref_removed + num_extid_v2_died_hhs_100` people
* Total of: `r num_extid_v2_mig_hhs_not_100` migrations + `r num_extid_v2_died_hhs_not_100` deaths + `r num_extid_v2_100_refusal` 100% refusals = `r num_extid_v2_mig_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v2_died_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v2_100_refusal` people   

Now when we remove migrations, deaths, and people in 100% refusal households, we get a V2 Clean of `r num_extid_v2_clean`.  

* `r num_extid_v2_total_visited` visited - `r num_extid_v2_mig_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v2_died_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v2_100_refusal` removed = `r num_extid_v2_total_visited - (num_extid_v2_mig_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v2_died_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v2_100_refusal)` V2 Clean

Now that the data has been cleaned, we will calculate the V3 Target number by adding the people missed in V2 to the V2 Clean. The V3 Target will reflect the number of people who can be visited in the next visit (out and in people).

* `r num_v2_in_target` in + `r num_v3_target_out` out = `r num_v2_in_target + num_v3_target_out` V3 Target   

However, for calculation purposes there will be a V3 Calculated Target which will include all people on the roster (in, out, refusals, and eos people who did not migrate, died or are part of a 100% refusal household):

* `r num_extid_v3_target_real` V3 Calculated Target

To double check everything that has been done, the V2 visited people's safety statuses are compared to V2 Clean and V3 Target below: 

```{r v2_safety_statuses}
knitr::kable(v2statuses)
```

* OUT: `r num_v2_out` V2 Visited out - `r num_v2_out_died` died - `r num_v2_out_mig` migrated =  `r num_v2_out - num_v2_out_died - num_v2_out_mig` V2 Clean out + `r num_extid_v2_not_visited` missed people = `r num_v3_target_out_start` OUT (participants who can still enter the study)
* REFUSAL: `r num_v2_refusal` - `r num_v2_ref_removed` people in 100% removal households = `r num_v2_refusal - num_v2_ref_removed` REFUSAL (participants who refused but belong to hh that are still part of the study).
* 32 women were starting safety status in, took drug, and became pregnant, meaning that they will leave safety and enter pfu. On the table above, they became status eos. Please visit the [PFU Report](https://d27fg4iv55pk9u.cloudfront.net/safety-efficacy/pfu_status_and_reason.html#V2_Numbers) to track these women. _Note: extid 14024-02 was removed from the count of `r v2_preg_pfu` pregnant women because she did not take drug. Also, 08016-02 was incorrectly enrolled into PFU because she did not take drug, however because she had an SAE her PFU submission has to be kept (therefore do not use 08016-02 in PFU analyses)._

We can check this in the following table:

```{r v2_safety_pathway}
knitr::kable(v2_status_pathway)
```
_NOTE: 45131-02, 45131-03, 45131-04, 45131-05, 45131-06, 45131-07, 45131-10, 45140-01, 45144-01, 45144-02, 45144-04, 45144-06, 45144-07 went 'out to in' in V1 and V2, altering the numbers of this table. 
***

### Safety V3

#### Household Level
While the target number of households to visit in Safety V3 was `r num_hhid_v3_target_real`, only `r num_hhid_v3_total_visited` households were visited. This means:

* `r num_hhid_v3_target_real` target hhs - `r num_hhid_v3_total_visited` visited hhs = `r num_hhid_v3_target_real - num_hhid_v3_total_visited` missed 

When we dive deeper to confirm that `r num_hhid_v3_target_real - num_hhid_v3_total_visited` households were missed, we find that `r num_hhid_v3_not_visited - num_v3_hhid_visited_extid_not` households were indeed not visited in V3.  

> _NOTE: `r num_v3_hhid_visited_extid_not` households were visited but only had Safety New members enrolled. The other members of the household had no data submitted for that visit._

Now that we have determined why the target hh and visited hh numbers differ, we will begin to find the V4 target number. To create the V4 target, we must remove the hh below:

* `r num_hhid_v3_ref_ref` households had all individuals refuse,  
* `r num_hhid_v3_all_migrations` households had all individuals migrate,  
* `r num_hhid_v3_all_death` households had all individuals die, and    
* `r num_hhid_v3_ref_mig_died` households had all individuals refuse, migrate, or die.
* Total of above = `r num_hhid_v3_ref_ref + num_hhid_v3_all_migrations + num_hhid_v3_all_death + num_hhid_v3_ref_mig_died`  

This means that `r num_hhid_v3_ref_ref + num_hhid_v3_all_migrations + num_hhid_v3_all_death + num_hhid_v3_ref_mig_died` households were removed.

The V3 Clean data will then have the following households:

* `r num_hhid_v3_total_visited` visited - `r num_hhid_v3_100_refusal` = `r num_hhid_v3_total_visited - num_hhid_v3_100_refusal` V3 Clean

To create the V4 target we want to keep only people who are 'in', including the 'in' people who were missed in V3. Therefore, we must remove the hh below:

* `r num_hhid_v3_removals` households that did not have at least one person in.  

Finally, to create the V4 target we want to keep all households with at least one person in (including households that were not visited in V3):

* `r length(unique(v3_clean$hhid))` V3 Clean + `r num_hhid_v3_not_visited - num_v3_hhid_visited_extid_not` not visited - `r num_hhid_v3_removals` houses with no in people = `r length(unique(v3_clean$hhid)) + (num_hhid_v3_not_visited - num_v3_hhid_visited_extid_not) - num_hhid_v3_removals` V4 target

So now there is a V4 target of `r num_hhid_v4_target_real` households.

#### Individual Level

In total `r num_extid_v3_total_visited` people were visited in Safety V3 of which `r num_extid_v3_new_visited` were new and `r num_extid_v3_og_visited` were OG. 

In the target for V3, new people were not accounted for, only the OG people. So when we compare the V3 calculated target and V3 OG visited we find that `r num_extid_v3_not_visited` people were not visited:  

* `r num_extid_v3_target_real` (calculated target) - `r num_extid_v3_og_visited` (OG visited) = `r num_extid_v3_target_real - num_extid_v3_og_visited` (missed people)
* These individuals are coming from the `r length(unique(v3_not_visited$hhid)) - length(unique(v3_hhid_visited_extid_not$hhid))` missed households + `r length(unique(v3_hhid_visited_extid_not$hhid))` households which had no Safety submissions (just Safety New Members).

Now that we understand why the target is different, let's clean V3 by removing all migrations, deaths, and 100% refusal households: 

* `r num_extid_v3_mig_hhs_not_100` migrations (which are not a part of 100% refusal households),    
* `r num_extid_v3_died_hhs_not_100` deaths (which are not a part of 100% refusal households), and    
* `r num_extid_v3_100_refusal` people belonging to 100% refusal households.
  + `r num_extid_v3_mig_hhs_100` people migrated, 
  + `r num_extid_v3_died_hhs_100` person died, and
  + `r num_v3_ref_removed` people refused.
  + Total: `r num_extid_v3_mig_hhs_100` + `r num_extid_v3_died_hhs_100` + `r num_v3_ref_removed` = `r num_extid_v3_mig_hhs_100 + num_v3_ref_removed + num_extid_v3_died_hhs_100` people
* Total of: `r num_extid_v3_mig_hhs_not_100` migrations + `r num_extid_v3_died_hhs_not_100` deaths + `r num_extid_v3_100_refusal` 100% refusals = `r num_extid_v3_mig_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v3_died_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v3_100_refusal` people   

Now when we remove migrations, deaths, and people in 100% refusal households, we get a V3 Clean of `r num_extid_v3_clean`.  

* `r num_extid_v3_total_visited` visited - `r num_extid_v3_mig_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v3_died_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v3_100_refusal` removed = `r num_extid_v3_total_visited - (num_extid_v3_mig_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v3_died_hhs_not_100 + num_extid_v3_100_refusal)` V3 Clean

Now that the data has been cleaned, we will calculate the V4 Target number which will reflect the number of people who can be visited during the next visit (in people).

* `r num_v3_in_target` in = `r num_v3_in_target` V4 Target   

We calculate the V4 Calculated Target which will include all people on the roster (in, out, refusals, and eos people who are a part of a household with at least 1 person in):

* `r num_extid_v4_target_real` V4 Calculated Target

To double check everything that has been done, the V3 visited people's safety statuses are compared to V3 Clean and V4 Target below: 

```{r v3_safety_statuses}
knitr::kable(v3statuses)
```

* EOS: `r num_extid_v3_eos` V3 Visited eos + `r num_extid_v3_eos_with` missed eos people - `r num_extid_v3_eos_rem` eos people part of households with no one in - `r num_extid_v3_eos_died` died - `r num_extid_v3_eos_mig` migrated = `r num_extid_v3_eos + num_extid_v3_eos_with- num_extid_v3_eos_rem - num_extid_v3_eos_mig - num_extid_v3_eos_died`
* OUT: `r num_v3_out` V3 Visited out - `r num_v3_out_died` died - `r num_v3_out_mig` migrated =  `r num_v3_out - num_v3_out_died - num_v3_out_mig` V3 Clean OUT     
* REFUSAL: `r num_v3_refusal` - `r num_v3_ref_removed` people in 100% removal households = `r num_v3_refusal - num_v3_ref_removed` V3 Clean REFUSAL (participants who refused but belong to hh that are still part of the study).
* PREGNANCIES: `r v3_preg_pfu` women were starting safety status in, took drug, and became pregnant, meaning that they will leave safety and enter pfu. On the table above, they became status eos. Please visit the [PFU Report](https://d27fg4iv55pk9u.cloudfront.net/safety-efficacy/pfu_status_and_reason.html#V3_Numbers) to track these women. _Note: extid 55077-02 was never actually pregnant, and while this data was removed from PFU, it was not fixed in Safety._

We can check this in the following table:

```{r v3_safety_pathway}
knitr::kable(v3_status_pathway)
```
_Note: 95076-02 went 'in to eos' in both V2 and V3. Therefore, in to eos in this table should not be 569 but rather 568 because had the tablets been updated between the visits, this extid would have already been identified as eos. Also, 83057-04 went 'out to refusal' in both V2 and V3, altering the values in the table. Finally, 83057-03, 83057-06, 83057-07, 83057-08, and 95066-02 went 'out to in' in bothV2 and V3 altering the numbers present in the table._

### Safety V4

#### Household Level
While the target number of households to visit in Safety V4 was `r num_hhid_v4_target_real`, only `r num_hhid_v4_total_visited` households were visited. This means:

* `r num_hhid_v4_target_real` target hhs - `r num_hhid_v4_total_visited` visited hhs = `r num_hhid_v4_target_real - num_hhid_v4_total_visited` missed 

When we dive deeper to confirm that `r num_hhid_v4_target_real - num_hhid_v4_total_visited` households were missed, we find that `r num_hhid_v4_not_visited - num_v4_hhid_visited_extid_not` households were indeed not visited in V4.  

Since V4 is the final visit, there is no need to create a target for the next visit.

#### Individual Level

In total `r num_extid_v4_total_visited` people were visited in Safety V4 of which `r num_extid_v4_new_visited` were new and `r num_extid_v4_og_visited` were OG. 

In the target for V4, new people were not accounted for, only the OG people. So when we compare the V4 calculated target and V4 OG visited we find that `r num_extid_v4_not_visited` people were not visited.

Now, let's look at how many people completed safety below:

```{r v4_safety_statuses}
knitr::kable(v4statuses)
```

* `r v4_preg_pfu` women were starting safety status in, took drug, and became pregnant, meaning that they will leave safety and enter pfu. On the table above, they became status eos. Please visit the [PFU Report](https://d27fg4iv55pk9u.cloudfront.net/safety-efficacy/pfu_status_and_reason.html#V4_Numbers) to track these women.

We can check this in the following table:
