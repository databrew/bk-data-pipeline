### PURPOSE:
# determine how many woman had submissions for PFU; enter only as in and only thing that can happen is become EOS. So interesting to know how many submissions and out of this how many are in and EOS and of EOS why EOS (miscarriage, abortion, etc.) ~ look at Paula's dm about this below.
# 1. Dead, migrated 2. Does not confirm 3. Absent 4 times on a row: LTFU (lost to follow up) 4. No longer pregnant; If not: What happened? □ Baby was born alive □ Miscarriage/loss of baby (no visible baby or less than 5 months since last menstrual period) □ Abortion (self-induced) □ Baby was born dead □ Prefer not to answer
